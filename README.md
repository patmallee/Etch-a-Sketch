Etch-A-Sketch

This project was put together as an assignment for the Odin Project's introductory section.

I was very new to the world of CSS and JQuery when I first wrote this (So try not to go too hard on me!). But suggestions are very much welcome, as I'd like to come back to it and try to clean it up in the near future once I work through some more front-end projects.

Assignment was to build a webpage that acted as an etch-a-sketch screen by using jquery hover calls to add color to moused-over tiles.

Finished repo contains 3 files:

1. index.html - actual webpage
2. EAS.css - typical css script, contains classes for both pre- and post-hovered states
3. EAS.js - contains JQuery commands to modify tile classes and rest board on button click


------NOTICE!
Apparently, I never finished this project, as my files seem to be not operating properly. On my to-do list to fix these ASAP for practice!
